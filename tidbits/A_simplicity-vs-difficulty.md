## Four Important Terms

Precision in language is like camera resolution: it makes for clearer images,
to a point. It is *very important* that, when I use the following words, you
know exactly what I mean. With this in mind, here's something I believe:

> Nix is _hard_ to learn, but it is _simpler_ than any alternative.

### "Easy" and "Hard"

Easy things require a low amount of effort to understand. Complex things can be
easy to understand, but typically aren't.

Hard things require a high amount of effort to understand. Simple things can be
hard to understand, but typically aren't.

### "Simple" and "Complex"

Simple things are easy to reason about, with time. They behave consistently and
don't surprise because they _can't_: the machine only does what it does. At the
extremes, simple things can make understanding systems very difficult and limit
our ability to make solutions appropriate for a problem.

Complex things _may_ become easier to reason about with time, but they tend to
violate prior understanding at inopportune times. Their machinery does more
than it must, and the failure "surface area" is greater than it need be. At the
extremes, complex things make improvement too expensive and invite superstition.

## Irreducible Complexity

"Irreducibly complex" things are only as complex as necessary for a task When
further simpliciation is impractical and qualified guarantees can be made, your
creation may have reached a state of irreducible complexity.
